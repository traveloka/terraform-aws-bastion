## Description

Terraform module to create ASG bastion host using ssm session manager on top of golden bastion AMI baked by site-infra team.
This module creates following resources:
* [aws_autoscaling_group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/autoscaling_group.html).
To stop or start an instances, you can change the asg_capacity value.
* [aws_launch_config](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/launch_configuration.html).
* [aws_security_group](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/security_group.html).
Several security group will be created by this module, to give access from this bastion, you need to attach the share security group to your database.

## Prerequisites
* An existing vpc.
* An existing subnet, recommended using private subnet.
* IAM Policy to grants access to use session manager and send logs to s3.

## Dependencies

This Terraform module uses another Terraform module, here is the list of Terraform module dependencies:

* [traveloka/terraform-aws-autoscaling](https://github.com/traveloka/terraform-aws-autoscaling)
* [traveloka/terraform-aws-iam-role](https://github.com/traveloka/terraform-aws-iam-role)
